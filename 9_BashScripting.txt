good practices to follow to write shell script : 

1. always comment your code 
2. write metadata about that particular script on top
3. set -x        to run script in debug mode
4. set -e        exit the script when there is an error 
5. set -o        pipefail





commands : 

1. ps -ef      command will list down all the processes that are running on system 
2. ps -ef | grep "amazon"       filter out all the processes, that are run by amazon 
3. ./firstScript.sh       will work only if you have included the #!/bin/bash     character in 
top of the file and also given the file permission to execute.....

4. bash firstScript.sh       will work coz you have explicitly specified the bash 

5. pipe symbol receives the output from stdout only ....
i.e. date | echo "today is "                -> will print only today is       and not the date .. coz 
date gives stdin    

6. awk    command is so powerful that it could give specific column from the output....
