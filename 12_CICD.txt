### **CI/CD Overview:**
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** The process where developers frequently merge code 
    into a shared repository, triggering automated testing to catch issues early.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Ensures that software is always in a deployable state
     by automating the deployment process after testing.


### **Key CI/CD Steps:**
1. **Unit Testing:** Testing individual code modules to ensure correctness.
2. **Static Code Analysis:** Scanning the code without execution to identify bugs,
     vulnerabilities, and code quality issues.
3. **Code Quality & Vulnerability Checks:** Tools like **SonarQube** ensure that code adheres
     to quality standards and is free from vulnerabilities.
4. **Automation Testing:** Functional and end-to-end tests simulate real-world usage scenarios.
5. **Reports Generation:** Collect and store metadata (test results, code coverage, etc.) 
    for analysis.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the application to environments such as development, staging,
     or production after all tests pass.

### **Task Management & Version Control:**
- **Jira:** Used to divide tasks into manageable parts, enabling better tracking.
- **Version Control System (VCS):** GitHub (or similar) stores code and manages versioning.

### **Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Orchestration:**
- **Jenkins** orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline, handling various stages such as 
    build, test, and deploy.
  - **Version Control (GitHub):** Developers push code to GitHub.
  - **Jenkins Pipelines:**
    - **Maven/JUnit** for building and testing.
    - **SonarQube** for code quality and vulnerability analysis.
    - **Kubernetes/Docker/EC2** for scaling and deploying.
    - **ALM Tools** for reporting and managing the application lifecycle.

#### **Example Pipeline:**
- A developer pushes version 1 to GitHub.
- **Jenkins** detects the change, pulls the code, builds it, runs tests, 
performs static code analysis, and then deploys the app to either a development,
 staging, or production environment.

### **Scaling Jenkins with Kubernetes:**
- **Jenkins Master-Worker Architecture:**
  - The **Jenkins Master** controls the pipeline.
  - **Jenkins Workers** execute the actual jobs (build, test, etc.).
  
- **Scaling Challenge:** Running multiple Jenkins workers on EC2 instances
 can be resource-heavy (CPU, RAM). Managing these instances manually 
 increases cost and complexity.
  
- **Solution with Kubernetes:**
  - Kubernetes can dynamically scale Jenkins workers by spinning up or down Docker containers
   based on the load.
  - Kubernetes handles load balancing, scaling, and resource management efficiently,
   ensuring that Jenkins pipelines run smoothly.

---

### **GitHub Actions vs. Jenkins:**
- **Jenkins:** A powerful platform but requires manual setup and configuration.
- **GitHub Actions:** Event-driven, integrated into GitHub, and triggers workflows 
    based on specific events like code pushes or pull requests.
  - **Kubernetes with Jenkins:** Used to scale pipelines efficiently.
  - **GitHub Actions:** Preferred for smaller, GitHub-native projects due to ease of setup
     and event-driven nature.

### **Jenkins Zero to Hero Setup:**

1. **Create an Ubuntu EC2 Instance:**
   - SSH into the instance and install Java (JDK).
   - Install Jenkins.
   - By default, Jenkins runs on port 8080, which is usually blocked for incoming traffic.

2. **Configure Jenkins Access:**
   - Update inbound rules for the EC2 instance to allow traffic on port 8080.
   - Retrieve the admin password with:
     ```bash
     sudo cat /password-file-location
     ```
   - Install common plugins for Jenkins.

3. **Jenkins Architecture:**
   - Jenkins should have a **master** to control pipelines and workers to execute jobs.
   - If a worker node (like EC2) is idle for too long, it can be expensive to maintain.
   - **Solution:** Use **Docker containers** for workers since containers 
    can be easily created or removed as needed.

4. **Install Docker on Jenkins Workers:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io
   ```
   - Grant Jenkins access to Docker:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
     su - jenkins
     ```

5. **Install Docker Pipeline Plugin in Jenkins:**
   - Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Install Docker Pipeline Plugin.

6. **Freestyle vs. Pipeline Projects:**
   - Earlier, Jenkins only supported **Freestyle Projects** where jobs were created
     using a GUI.
   - **Pipeline Projects** are now preferred since they use a declarative approach via
         **Jenkinsfile** (written in Groovy), allowing code-driven pipelines.
   
   - **Pipeline Syntax Generator:** Helps generate pipeline code for various stages
     (build, test, deploy).

7. **Docker Pipeline Workflow:**
   - Jenkins fetches code from GitHub.
   - Searches for the required Docker image (build environment). 
        If unavailable, Jenkins creates one.
   - After the job finishes, the container is automatically removed.

---

### **Multi-Stage Pipelines:**
- Multi-stage pipelines allow different environments (frontend, backend, database) 
    to run in parallel:
  - **Frontend (Ubuntu)**
  - **Backend (Oracle)**
  - **Database (CentOS VM)**

  Each stage executes in a separate container, which can be dynamically created and removed 
    to reduce maintenance overhead.

---

### **ArgoCD for Continuous Delivery:**
- **ArgoCD** is a tool for continuous delivery (CD), allowing you to manage 
    Kubernetes applications with GitOps.
- A typical setup might involve:
  - GitHub -> Jenkins -> ArgoCD/Ansible -> Kubernetes/Production.

---

### **Jenkins Interview Questions:**
1. **Explain the CI/CD Process for Web Development:**
   - Discuss stages like version control, build, test, static code analysis, and deployment.
2. **How Do You Handle Worker Nodes in Jenkins?**
   - Use Docker containers as Jenkins workers, allowing dynamic scaling and easy management.
