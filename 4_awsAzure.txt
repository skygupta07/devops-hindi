earlier startups would have their own datacenters but nowadays even big
organizations rely on 2nd party data center services for their vms

aws console    , azure portal



let's say on regular basis you are requested to create 100 vms daily, then 
creating so much vms manually is hectic , so we use automation here...
    (we use aws ec2 api) -> now he can write scripts

popular cloud service providers are: aws, azure, gcp, digital ocean

user request should be valid , authenticate, authorised to create ec2 instance.

we can write scripts using aws cli, aws api, aws cdk (boto 3 -> python library),
aws CFT (cloud formation template), terraform

terraform is one of the alternate to automate resource creation (platform independent ->
i.e. it can automate my resources on aws, azure, gcp or anywhere...)

ec2 instance or virtual machines all are infrastructure...

if you have option to choose amazon cli or terraform , and you know that your 
company is very much specific to using only aws services then in that case it is 
better that you choose aws cli over terraform..

but nowadays we can see organizations using hybrid cloud system... for example 
companies prefer gcp for ai/ml things.. then in case terraform is good to go

it is very important to store key-value pair , else you would not be able to 
login again to your ec2 instance without using key - value

-------- let's say you have created your ec2 instance , now you want to access that 
vitual machine on your windows...then for that i downloaded the mobaxterm app from chrome and 
installed it on my pc.....then usme jaake vm type select kara, key-value wali 
file upload kari...and i was able to login to ec2 instance...
